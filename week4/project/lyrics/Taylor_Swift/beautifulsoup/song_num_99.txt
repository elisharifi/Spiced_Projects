Took a deep breath in the mirror 
He didn’t like it when I wore high heels, but I do 
Turned the lock and put my headphones on 
He always said he didn’t get this song but I do, I do 

Walked in expecting you’d be late 
But you got here early 
And you stand and wait 
And I walk to you 
You pulled my chair out and helped me in
And you don’t know how nice that is 
But I do 

And you throw your head back laughing like a little kid 
I think it’s strange that you think I’m funny ‘cause he never did 
I’ve been spending the last 8 months thinking all love ever does 
Is break and burn and end 
But on a Wednesday in a Café I watched it begin again 

You said you never met one girl 
Who has as many James Taylor records as you 
But I do 
We tell stories and you don’t know why I’m coming off a little shy 
But I do 

But you throw your head back laughing like a little kid 
I think it’s strange that you think I’m funny ‘cause he never did 
I’ve been spending the last 8 months thinking all love ever does 
Is break and burn and end 
But on a Wednesday in a Café I watched it begin again 

And we walk down the block to my car 
And I almost brought him up 
But you start to talk about the movies 
That your family watches every single Christmas 
And I won’t talk about that 
For the first time, what’s past is past 

‘Cause you throw your head back laughing like a little kid 
I think it’s strange that you think I’m funny ‘cause he never did 
I’ve been spending the last 8 months thinking all love ever does 
Is break and burn and end 
Then on a Wednesday in a Café I watched it begin again 
Then on a Wednesday in a Café I watched it begin again
